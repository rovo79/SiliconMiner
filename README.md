# SiliconMiner
A miner optimized for Apple Silicon M series processors.
Build a miner specifically architected to take full advantage of the M series unified memory shared across the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. 

Move away from virtualization and code porting of existing projects, and instead build with native libraries and frameworks provided by Apple.
