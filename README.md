# SiliconMiner
A miner optimized for Apple Silicon M series processors.
Build a miner specifically architected to take full advantage of the M series unified memory shared across the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. 

Move away from virtualization and code porting of existing projects, and instead build with native libraries and frameworks provided by Apple.

## Implementation of the Compute Kernel using the Metal Framework in Swift

To implement the compute kernel for mining XMR using the Metal framework in Swift, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Compute Kernel Function**: Write Swift code to define the kernel function, its inputs, outputs, and necessary data structures and helper functions.

2. **Create a Compute Pipeline State Object**: Use the Metal framework to create a compute pipeline state object for the kernel function.

3. **Dispatch the Kernel to GPU and Neural Engine Cores**: Use the `MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder` class to dispatch the kernel to all available cores on the GPU and neural engine.

4. **Parallelize the Work on CPU Cores**: Use Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to parallelize the work on the CPU cores.

5. **Test and Debug the Code**: Run the code and measure its performance. Use debugging tools such as breakpoints and print statements to identify and fix any issues.

6. **Refine and Optimize the Code**: Experiment with different configurations and fine-tune the code as needed. Optimize the kernel code and parallelization strategies to improve performance.
